## 1. Executive Summary

[View Executive Summary](MondayCoffee%20Report.pdf#page=1)

Monday Coffee has generated **₹3.86M+** in cumulative revenue, with Q4 2023 contributing **₹1.44M** (~37%), signaling strong recent momentum. Performance is split across a two-tier market structure: high-value cities and high-volume but lower-yield cities.

**Pune, Chennai, and Bangalore** form the high-value cluster, driven by superior customer economics. Pune leads with ₹1.26M revenue and the highest average spend per customer (₹24,197), while Chennai and Bangalore maintain similarly strong spending levels (₹22K per customer). In contrast, Delhi and Jaipur have the largest customer bases (68 and 69 customers respectively) but significantly lower spend (₹11K per customer), indicating weaker monetization despite scale.

Market penetration remains extremely low across major cities, highlighting substantial growth headroom. For instance, **Delhi (7.75M estimated consumers)** and **Mumbai (5.1M)** have disproportionately small active customer bases, pointing to underutilized demand. On the product side, **Cold Brew Coffee Pack (1,326 units sold)** is the leading SKU, reinforcing its role as the primary revenue driver.

Overall, Pune, Chennai, and Bangalore present the strongest expansion opportunities due to high revenue concentration, strong customer lifetime value, and favorable rent-to-revenue ratios. Meanwhile, large markets like Delhi and Mumbai require targeted customer acquisition strategies to unlock their full potential.

## Problem Statement

Monday, a coffee retailer brand that began selling its products in 2023, is looking to expand its physical presence by opening new café locations across India. Despite growing online sales, the company lacks clarity on which cities offer the strongest market opportunity based on actual consumer demand, revenue performance, and cost efficiency.

The core business challenge is: **which cities should Monday Coffee prioritise for physical expansion, and why?**

Without a structured analysis of sales performance, customer behaviour, and market sizing, the expansion strategy risks being driven by assumption rather than data.

-----

## Project Objectives

**Quantify the coffee consumer market** in each city based on population estimates.
**Evaluate revenue performance** by city, including quarterly and monthly growth trends.
**Identify top-performing products** by sales volume, both overall and at a city level.
**Assess customer value** by measuring average sales per customer across cities.
**Benchmark operating costs** by comparing average rent per customer against revenue generated.
**Recommend the top 3 cities** for physical store expansion based on data-driven insights.

-----

## Project Overview

This project is a business intelligence task supporting a strategic expansion decision. Using a relational database of city demographics, product listings, customer records, and transaction data, SQL queries were written to answer **10** key business questions spanning market sizing, revenue analysis, product performance, and cost efficiency.

### Database Schema

The project uses four relational tables:

|Table      |Description                                                          |

## 2. Key Insights

[View Key Insights, it on **PAGE 2** after the executive summary](MondayCoffee%20Report.pdf#page=2)

### 2.1 Revenue Performance

Pune leads all cities in both total and Q4 2023 revenue, confirming its position as the highest-performing market. Chennai and Bangalore follow closely, forming a premium-revenue tier.

|**City** |**Q4 2023 Revenue (₹)**|**All-Time Revenue (₹)**|**Active Customers**|
|---------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
|Pune     |434,330                |1,258,290               |52                  |
|Chennai  |302,500                |944,120                 |42                  |
|Bangalore|270,780                |860,110                 |39                  |
|Jaipur   |248,580                |803,450                 |69                  |
|Delhi    |238,490                |750,420                 |68                  |

### 2.2 Customer Value & Spend

Average spend per customer is highest in Pune (₹24,198), Chennai (₹22,479), and Bangalore (₹22,054) — more than double the per-customer spend seen in Delhi (₹11,036) and Jaipur (₹11,644). This premium-spend behavior in the top three cities is a strong indicator of customer loyalty and product-market fit.

|**City** |**Avg. Spend / Customer (₹)**|**Avg. Rent / Customer (₹)**|**Efficiency Index**|
|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
|Pune     |24,197.88                    |294.23                      |High                |
|Chennai  |22,479.05                    |407.14                      |High                |
|Bangalore|22,054.10                    |761.54                      |Moderate            |

### 2.3 Product Portfolio

Four core coffee products drive the overwhelming majority of sales volume. Cold Brew Coffee Pack (6 Bottles) leads with 1,326 units, a 4.3% margin over second-place Ground Espresso Coffee. Merchandise (Tote Bag) trails significantly, indicating limited appetite for non-consumable items at current pricing or placement.

|**Product**                      |**Units Sold**|**Rank**|
|---------------------------------|--------------|--------|
|Cold Brew Coffee Pack (6 Bottles)|1,326         |#1      |
|Ground Espresso Coffee (250g)    |1,271         |#2      |
|Instant Coffee Powder (100g)     |1,226         |#3      |
|Coffee Beans (500g)              |1,218         |#4      |
|Tote Bag with Coffee Design      |776           |#5      |

### 2.4 Market Penetration

Despite having the largest estimated coffee consumer base (7.75M), Delhi has only 68 active customers, a penetration rate that trails Chennai, which converts 42 customers from a base of just 2.78M. This signals a structural under-performance in Delhi relative to market size and represents a material opportunity.

|**City** |**Est. Coffee Consumers (M)**|**Active Customers**|**Penetration Signal**|
|---------|-----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
|Delhi    |7.75                         |68                  |Under-penetrated      |
|Mumbai   |5.10                         |27                  |Under-penetrated      |
|Kolkata  |3.73                         |28                  |Low                   |
|Bangalore|3.08                         |39                  |Moderate              |
|Chennai  |2.78                         |42                  |Strong                |

### 2.5 Sales Growth Momentum

Month-on-month sales growth data highlights strong positive momentum in select cities. Ahmedabad recorded 94% growth in November 2023, Jaipur 51% in October 2023, and Pune 69% in July 2023. These spikes may reflect seasonal demand, promotional activity, or new customer acquisition — all warranting further investigation to assess repeatability.

### 3.1 Strategic Value Delivered

**Key strategic outputs produced:**

|Impact Area              |What Was Delivered                                                   |Business Value                                                       |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Expansion Prioritisation |Ranked Pune, Chennai & Bangalore as top 3 expansion cities           |Saves the business from misallocating capital into low-yield markets |
|Market Opportunity Sizing|Quantified Delhi’s 7.75M consumer base vs. only 68 active customers  |Identified a high-potential untapped market worth targeting          |
|Revenue Benchmarking     |Revealed Pune generates ₹1.26M all-time with only 52 customers       |Proved that quality of customers matters more than volume            |
|Cost Efficiency Mapping  |Compared rent-per-customer (₹294 in Pune) vs. average spend (₹24,198)|Validated Pune as the most profitable physical location candidate    |
|Product Strategy Clarity |Identified Cold Brew & Ground Espresso as top revenue drivers        |Focused inventory and promotional strategy on proven SKUs            |
|Merchandising Red Flag   |Flagged Tote Bag underperformance (776 units, 41% below top SKUs)    |Flagged a product line for review or discontinuation                 |
|Growth Signal Detection  |Surfaced 50–94% MoM revenue spikes in Ahmedabad and Jaipur           |Exposed momentum that was previously invisible without trend analysis|

### 3.2 Business Decisions Enabled

The analysis directly enabled five concrete business decisions that the leadership team could not have made with confidence before this project:

**1. Capital Allocation Decision**
The Board can now approve expansion budgets for Pune, Chennai, and Bangalore with quantified justification Pune’s ₹294 rent-per-customer against ₹24,198 average spend creates one of the most compelling unit economics cases in the dataset.

**2. Customer Acquisition Strategy for Delhi**
By surfacing Delhi’s structural under penetration (7.75M consumers, only 68 customers), the analysis created the case for a dedicated, city-specific acquisition campaign digital outreach, corporate partnerships, or localised promotions where none previously existed.

**3. Inventory & Supplier Prioritisation**
Confirming Cold Brew and Ground Espresso as the top two products by volume gives procurement and operations teams a data backed anchor for inventory planning, supplier negotiations, and promotional scheduling.

**4. Merchandising Strategy Review**
The Tote Bag’s 41% underperformance relative to core SKUs  now visible for the first time puts the product line on the agenda for a Board-level review, allowing the business to either reposition it as a gift add-on or cut costs associated with it.


**In total, this project transformed 4 raw data tables across 10 cities into 5 strategic recommendations, 7 quantified business insights, and a reusable analytical framework delivering the clarity needed for Monday Coffee to pursue a disciplined, data-led national expansion.**

-----

## 4. Recommendations

[View Recommendations, it on **PAGE 3** after the key insights](MondayCoffee%20Report.pdf#page=3)

Based on analysis of revenue performance, customer value, market penetration, and operational cost efficiency, the following five actions are recommended.

**1. Prioritize Expansion into Pune, Chennai & Bangalore**
These three cities deliver the highest revenue, strongest customer spend, and favorable rent economics. Pune’s rent-per-customer of just ₹294 versus a ₹24,198 average spend creates a compelling unit economics case. Board should approve dedicated expansion budgets for new outlets or increased marketing investment in this tier.

**2. Activate Delhi’s Untapped Market Potential**
Delhi has India’s largest estimated coffee consumer base (7.75M) yet ranks 5th in revenue. A targeted acquisition campaign through digital channels, corporate partnerships, or localized promotions could yield significant revenue uplift with minimal incremental infrastructure investment.

**3. Double Down on Cold Brew & Core Coffee Products**
Cold Brew Coffee Pack and Ground Espresso account for over half of all units sold. Inventory planning, supplier negotiations, and promotional calendars should be anchored around these products. Consider bundling strategies to increase average order value and cross-sell Instant Coffee Powder and Beans alongside top sellers.

**4. Review & Reposition the Merchandise Line**
The Tote Bag (776 units) underperforms the core coffee portfolio by 41%. The Board should review the merchandising strategy: either repositioning tote bags as gift-set add-ons, renegotiating supplier costs to improve margins, or discontinuing if contribution remains below threshold.

**5. Formalize Growth Tracking & Monthly Revenue Reporting**
Growth spikes of 50–94% in cities like Ahmedabad and Jaipur suggest untapped momentum that is not yet being systematically captured or amplified. A monthly performance dashboard presented to the Board, covering revenue growth, customer acquisition, and per-city profitability, will enable faster, data-driven capital allocation decisions.

-----

## 5. Conclusion

Monday Coffee is well-positioned for growth. The data confirms a premium market exists, concentrated in Pune, Chennai, and Bangalore, where strong customer economics justify accelerated investment. Simultaneously, large, under-served markets in Delhi and Mumbai offer meaningful near-term upside. Executing against these five recommendations will strengthen Monday Coffee’s competitive position, improve capital efficiency, and build a foundation for disciplined, data-led national expansion.
